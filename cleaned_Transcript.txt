in this video we are going to go over a

way that we can quickly distinguish a

polar molecule from a non-polar molecule

now it's easier if you know what to look

for when a molecule is nonpolar and

before you find out what to look for

when it's

polar the first category of non-polar

molecules are those that are made up of

one element for example if you have a

monoatomic atom or a datomic atom that's

completely posed of one element it's

nonpolar examples include for example uh

N2 that's a diatomic molecule um

O2

cl2 um F2 H2 these are all

non-polar and some of the monoatomic

gases like helium neon argon Xenon the

noble gases um those are also non-polar

the next category to look for is

um a molecule that contains only carbon

and hydrogen those molecules are

non-polar so for example methane um your

alkanes

c2h6 eth ch2 double bond ch2 these are

composed only of carbon and hydrogen and

therefore they are

non-polar the carbon hydrogen bond is

nonpolar

the third area to look for is if the

molecule has symmetry so for example um

carbon

tetrafluoride notice that all of the

outer elements are the same uh this

molecule has symmetry this is

non-polar um sulfur hexor not yeah

sulfur

hexabromide all of the outer elements

are identical this molecule is also uh

nonpolar carbon

dioxide another nonpolar molecule the

two outer elements the oxygen are the

chloride that's another non-polar

molecule each of these molecules they

have symmetry as you can see

trihydride also uh

nonpolar now

let's let's say if the molecule lacks

symmetry is it always going to be polar

well it all depends on the

difference if the electro negativity

difference if it's less than

0.5 then um it's going to be non-polar

if it's more polar let me give you an

example of that

so iodine monob bromide iodine has an

electro negativity value of 2.5 and for

Bromine it's about 2.8 because the

difference is like3 this bond is

relatively

non-polar another example if there's no

symmetry is bromine

monochloride chlorine has an electro

negativity value of 3.0 and here once

again thean difference is less than 0.5

so that molecule is

non-polar so those are some quick ways

that you can use to identify if

molecules nonpolar if it doesn't meet

those characteristics generally it's

polar so what are some quick ways to

identify polar molecules the first thing

is if you see um if a molecule has

hydrogen bonding it's going to be polar

so if hydrogen is directly attached to

nitrogen oxygen or Florine it's polar

examples include

water um

HF ch3 o even though the carbon hydrogen

bond is nonpolar the presence of the

alcohol means that you have hydrogen

bonding and therefore it's going to be

polar uh ch3

nh2 um because of the

nh2 um it's polar ch3 Co once again

because of the O It's

polar now also if the molecule lacks

Symmetry and if the bond is polar then

it's going to be a polar molecule here's

another example

here the

oxygens here these oxygen are identical

and it has symmetry which makes it

non-polar here this molecule um it does

not have symmetry like uh this one

did carbon has an electr negativity

value of

2.5 oxygen is

3.5 so this bond is

polar here for sulfur it's also 2.5 so

that carbon sulfur bond is non-polar but

because of the carbon oxygen Bond it's

polar in the case on the right when we

have carbon dioxide even though the

carbon oxygen bond is polar because of

two of them because of the Symmetry

those dipole moments cancel out and

therefore um CO2 is non-polar but if you

replace one of the oxygen with a sulfur

molecule then it becomes uh

F notice that it's similar to

um to this molecule right

here the carbon Florine bond is very

polar carbon has an electronegativity

value of 2.5 and for Florine it's 4.0

it's well above that 0.5 difference and

um so because of the carbon Florine Bond

it's polar the carbon hyd hydrogen bond

is relatively non-polar so the dipole

moments are very small for that but in

this case over here these diap moments

they cancel and that's why because if

you have symmetry it makes it non-polar

but because this molecule lacks symmetry

it's going to be

polar another example is sulfur dioxide

cuz sometimes the shape of the molecule

can affect the

polarity see carbon dioxide which looks

very similar to sulfur dioxide and the

fact that there's two oxygens and one

atom in the middle um because carbon

dioxide has a linear shape the diap

moments they cancel but because sulfur

dioxide has a vent shape the arrows the

diap moment they don't

cancel and you can see um because of the

lone pair this molecule lacks symmetry

polar the last example is if you look at

NH3 even though it has has hydrogen

bonding which makes it polar um the

geometry also makes it polar as

well if you draw the arrows they all

Point towards the partially negative

Florine atom and they point in One

Direction they don't cancel and that's

another reason why this molecule is

polar so just to review molecules that

are non-polar tend to be um

diatomic um molecules that are composed

of one element or monoatomic atoms like

noble gases they could be pure

hydrocarbons or they could be molecules

that have symmetry where all of the

outer elements are the

same if you see that 99% of the time

it's going to be

non-polar if you don't see it for the

most part it's probably going to be

polar but just to be on a safe side um

look at the electro negativity values if

it's greater than 0.5 um draw the arrow

from the partially positive atom to The

partially negative atom and if the

arrows don't cancel then your molecule

is going to be

polar so hopefully this uh video will

help you to quickly distinguish polar

non-polar molecules and uh I wish you
