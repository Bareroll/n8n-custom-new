polar here for sulfur it's also 2.5 so

[00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840]
that carbon sulfur bond is non-polar but

[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.150]
that carbon sulfur bond is non-polar but

[00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160]
because of the carbon oxygen Bond it's

[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.590]
because of the carbon oxygen Bond it's

[00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600]
polar in the case on the right when we

[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.110]
polar in the case on the right when we

[00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120]
have carbon dioxide even though the

[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.029]
have carbon dioxide even though the

[00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039]
carbon oxygen bond is polar because of

[00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:12.230]
carbon oxygen bond is polar because of

[00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240]
two of them because of the Symmetry

[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.990]
two of them because of the Symmetry

[00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000]
those dipole moments cancel out and

[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.189]
those dipole moments cancel out and

[00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:18.199]
therefore um CO2 is non-polar but if you

[00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:20.070]
therefore um CO2 is non-polar but if you

[00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080]
replace one of the oxygen with a sulfur

[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.909]
replace one of the oxygen with a sulfur

[00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919]
molecule then it becomes uh

[00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:27.950]
molecule then it becomes uh

[00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960]
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:35.110 align:start position:0%

[00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120]
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.710 align:start position:0%

[00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720]
F notice that it's similar to

[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.790]
F notice that it's similar to

[00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800]
um to this molecule right

[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.670]
um to this molecule right

[00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680]
here the carbon Florine bond is very

[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.510]
here the carbon Florine bond is very

[00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520]
polar carbon has an electronegativity

[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.230]
polar carbon has an electronegativity

[00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240]
value of 2.5 and for Florine it's 4.0

[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.590]
value of 2.5 and for Florine it's 4.0

[00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600]
it's well above that 0.5 difference and

[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.510]
it's well above that 0.5 difference and

[00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520]
um so because of the carbon Florine Bond

[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.150]
um so because of the carbon Florine Bond

[00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160]
it's polar the carbon hyd hydrogen bond

[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.029]
it's polar the carbon hyd hydrogen bond

[00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039]
is relatively non-polar so the dipole

[00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:05.990]
is relatively non-polar so the dipole

[00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000]
moments are very small for that but in

[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.629]
moments are very small for that but in

[00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639]
this case over here these diap moments

[00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:11.870]
this case over here these diap moments

[00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880]
they cancel and that's why because if

[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.150]
they cancel and that's why because if

[00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160]
you have symmetry it makes it non-polar

[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.749]
you have symmetry it makes it non-polar

[00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:16.759]
but because this molecule lacks symmetry

[00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:19.150]
but because this molecule lacks symmetry

[00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160]
it's going to be

[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.390]
it's going to be

[00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400]
polar another example is sulfur dioxide

[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.710]
polar another example is sulfur dioxide

[00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720]
cuz sometimes the shape of the molecule

[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.830]
cuz sometimes the shape of the molecule

[00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840]
can affect the

[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.830]
can affect the

[00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840]
polarity see carbon dioxide which looks

[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.469]
polarity see carbon dioxide which looks

[00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479]
very similar to sulfur dioxide and the

[00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:36.469]
very similar to sulfur dioxide and the

[00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479]
fact that there's two oxygens and one

[00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:38.909]
fact that there's two oxygens and one

[00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:38.919]
atom in the middle um because carbon

[00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:40.550]
atom in the middle um because carbon

[00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560]
dioxide has a linear shape the diap

[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.990]
dioxide has a linear shape the diap

[00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.000]
moments they cancel but because sulfur

[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.909]
moments they cancel but because sulfur

[00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919]
dioxide has a vent shape the arrows the

[00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:48.189]
dioxide has a vent shape the arrows the

[00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:48.199]
diap moment they don't

diap moment they don't

[00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:50.680]
cancel and you can see um because of the

[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.629]
cancel and you can see um because of the

[00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639]

polar the last example is if you look at

[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.990]
polar the last example is if you look at

NH3 even though it has has hydrogen

[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.309]
NH3 even though it has has hydrogen

[00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319]
bonding which makes it polar um the

[00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:07.749]
bonding which makes it polar um the

[00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:07.759]
geometry also makes it polar as

[00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:10.230]
geometry also makes it polar as

[00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:10.240]
well if you draw the arrows they all

[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.790]
well if you draw the arrows they all

[00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800]
Point towards the partially negative

[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.710]
Point towards the partially negative

[00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720]
Florine atom and they point in One

[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.950]
Florine atom and they point in One

[00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:16.960]
Direction they don't cancel and that's

Direction they don't cancel and that's

[00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:18.440]
another reason why this molecule is

another reason why this molecule is

[00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039]
polar so just to review molecules that

polar so just to review molecules that

[00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.280]

[00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639]
that have symmetry where all of the

outer elements are the

[00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000]
same if you see that 99% of the time

non-polar if you don't see it for the

most part it's probably going to be

most part it's probably going to be

[00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680]
polar but just to be on a safe side um

[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.070]
polar but just to be on a safe side um

[00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.080]
look at the electro negativity values if

[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.830]
look at the electro negativity values if

[00:07:58.830 --> 00:07:58.840]
it's greater than 0.5 um draw the arrow

[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.790]
it's greater than 0.5 um draw the arrow

[00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:00.800]
from the partially positive atom to The

from the partially positive atom to The

polar so hopefully this uh video will

[00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:13.270]
polar so hopefully this uh video will

[00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:13.280]
help you to quickly distinguish polar

[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.950]
help you to quickly distinguish polar

[00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:15.960]
non-polar molecules and uh I wish you

[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:20.440]
non-polar molecules and uh I wish you
